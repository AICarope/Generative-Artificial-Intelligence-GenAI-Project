Project based work created a Product Requirement Document (PRD) and a prototype for a GenAI Agent that supports children with ADHD the product is called WISE.AI. The Agent empowers children with emotional control, time management and scheduling. Personas: Children, Parents, Teachers and Clinical Providers. Users input emotional states and challenges; WISE.AI gathers context from a large knowledge base and offers personalized strategies. (See GenAI WISE.AI PRD)

Execution of various class labs using APIs to call a model in ChatGPT v. 3.5 turbo and v.4, Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), for a large document to be processed and converted into manageable chunks. Additionally, use a LLM to apply fine-tuning with LoRA for enhanced performance and tailored outputs. (See Labs)
